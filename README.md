# Introduction

This is my VIM configuration, I make this repository to be able to access this 
configuration from anywhere. Be aware, I use vim-plug as plugin manager for VIM,
If you like to taste my VIM configuration follow the Installation Section.

# Installation
    
If you've already configured VIM, please first of all create a backup:

`mv .vim/ myoldvim`

Then, let's install it:

`git clone https://github.com/greatbahram/dotvim.git ~/.vim`

Finally create a symbolic link:
